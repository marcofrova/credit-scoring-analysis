### 📊 Key Features
- **Custom IRLS Solver**: Implementation of MLE for Logistic Regression.
- **Business Optimization**: Threshold selection based on asymmetric costs (False Positives cost 5x more than False Negatives).
- **Bayesian Inference**: Posterior analysis via MCMC for robust coefficient estimation.
- **Three-Way Policy**: Triage system (Auto-approve / Manual Review / Decline).
